# Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs from the user and calculates their sum. 
# The program should perform the following tasks:

a = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the sum of the two numbers
sum = a + b

# Print the sum of the two numbers
print("The sum of the two numbers is: ", sum)
