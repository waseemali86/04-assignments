# Ask the user for a number and print its square (the product of the number times itself).



# ---SOLUTION---

# Prompt the user for a number
number = float(input("Enter a number: "))    # Use float() to allow for decimal numbers
print(f"{number} squared is {number**2}.")    # Use ** to raise the number to the power of 2
